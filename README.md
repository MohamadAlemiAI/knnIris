# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification on Iris Dataset

This repository contains a Python script for classifying the Iris dataset using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset.

## Features
The dataset contains 150 observations of iris plants. There are four features describing the width and length of the sepals and petals, by centimeters, and three species of iris plants.

## Model
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is used to classify the iris species based on the given features.

## Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Usage
Run the script to train the KNN classifier and evaluate its performance on the test set.

## Output
The script will output a classification report detailing the precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each class.
